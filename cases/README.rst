====================
``dtf`` Case Modules
====================

The ``cases/`` directory in the ``dtf`` repository provides a number
of example case modules and may provide the basis for your own example
base modules. 

See ``case.py`` <https://github.com/tychoish/dtf/blob/master/dtf/cases.py> f
or the implementation of the ``DtfCase`` base class 
that you can use to help write test cases, and the cases directory
<https://github.com/tychoish/dtf/tree/master/cases> for a number of
examples that you use when building your own test cases. Generally,
you should store all case implementation in your project repository
with all test definitions.
