=============================
Document Test Framework (dtf)
=============================

``dtf`` is a test runner, designed to help coordinate and enforce
consistency requirements for large documentation projects, though its
implementation may be more broadly useful. Ideally ``dtf`` will help
facilitate easy, regular and automated testing for documentation
source and production output, and ease the burden burden of manual
consistency editing and checking, and help increase the quality of
tests without increasing the workload for editors and documentation
maintainers.

``dtf`` does not run Python ``unittest`` tests or coordinate with
existing test frameworks (at this time.)
