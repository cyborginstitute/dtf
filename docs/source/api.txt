Documentation Testing Framework API
===================================

The :doc:`cases module </api/cases>` provides the primary API used in
the course of normal dtf use. The complete API documentation that
follows is mostly to explain the implementation and internal operation
of :mod:`dtf` as a whole; however, if you're interested in developing
case definitions, consider the documentation of :doc:`cases.py
</api/cases>`.
