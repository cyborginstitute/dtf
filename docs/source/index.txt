Documentation Testing Framework
===============================

The Documentation Testing Framework, or :mod:`dtf` is a tool for
specifying consistency tests for documentation to help ameliorate the
maintenance costs for large documentation projects that target rapidly
changing software.

Users specify "cases" to describe abstract conditions by writing
simple Python modules, and then define "tests" using a simple
YAML-based document form that describe specific situations where a
case must hold true. See the :doc:`tutorial </tutorial>` for more
information on getting started with :mod:`dtf`.
