   test
      A :term:`YAML` document that defines a situation that :mod:`dtf`
      will verify. Each :term:`case` reads and confirms one or more
      tests. Tests are all distinct.

   case
      A Python module that defines a kind of consistency that
      :mod:`dtf` can use in combination with :term:`test` to ensure
      consistency in a documentation set.

   YAML
      *Yet another markup language*, a data interchange format. Used
      by :mod:`dtf` for its human-read and edibility.
